issues as off now

reloading awesome also reloads polybar
simple press superkey+b twice to fix
will fix this soon its only because off my laziness in rc.lua
discord auto opens - remove near bottom off rc.lua if u dont like it

firefox - just google firefox nord theme and download :)

edit rc.lua near bottom for wallpapers and dirs so on

/titlebars go into ~/.config/awesome
